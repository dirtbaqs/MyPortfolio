        <h1>I Am Poem</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I am sad and happy
            <br>I wonder what's for lumch
            <br>I hear a lawnmower outside
            <br>I see things from my schitzophrenia
            <br>I want the Thanos snap
            <br>I am sad and happy
            <br>
            <br>I pretend to be happy
            <br>I feel your eyeballs
            <br>I touch your spaghetti
            <br>I worry about ur mom
            <br>I cry for Cartoon Network cause its going downhill
            <br>I am sad and happy
            <br>
            <br>I understand that we all disappear
            <br>I say Thanos caused half the population to turn into dust
            <br>I dream that I dream
            <br>I try to not use 10% of my power against everyone
            <br>I hope that I stop wasting time
            <br>I am sad and happy
